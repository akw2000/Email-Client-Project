Email Client Project
====================

This project was undertaken as part of the B.Sc. Engineering Semester 2 program construction module offered by the Computer Science and Engineering degree at the University of Moratuwa. The goal of the project was to create an automated email client using Java, incorporating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and design patterns.

Duration
--------

The project spanned six weeks and was completed in July 2022.

Technologies Used
-----------------

The email client was developed using the Java programming language. The following packages were utilized for its functionality:

*   `javax.mail` (Download link: [javax.mail.jar](https://bit.ly/2v4Enoa))
*   `javax.activation` (Download link: [javax.activation.jar](https://bit.ly/3JuN7JS))

Features
--------

The email client includes the following features:

1.  Sending Emails: The program allows users to send emails to recipients. It utilizes the `javax.mail` package for email-sending functionality.
    
2.  Recipient List Management: The client provides functionality to manage a recipient list. Users can add, remove, and update recipients in the list.
    
3.  Automated Birthday Emails: The program has the capability to send automated birthday emails to recipients who have a birthday on a specific date. This feature enhances the personalization and automation of the email client.
    
4.  Email Object Serialization: The application includes functionality to serialize email objects. This allows for the persistence and storage of email data for future use.
    
5.  Input Validation: The email client incorporates input validation to ensure that user-provided data is in the correct format and meets the necessary requirements. This helps prevent errors and enhances the reliability of the program.
    
6.  Email Report Generation: The client is capable of generating email reports, providing insights and statistics on sent emails, recipient engagement, and other relevant information.
